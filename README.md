# Bleeter
UI for GTA V's microblogging site built using F# and Fable

## Why Bleeter
Bleeter is GTA V's Twitter parody website. Few months ago, I learned about a functional programming language called F# and how it could be used to develop front-end applications using Fable compiler. Since I always wanted to develop Bleeter, I thought why not develop it using F# and see how it goes.

This website also uses React, React Router and Tailwind CSS.
